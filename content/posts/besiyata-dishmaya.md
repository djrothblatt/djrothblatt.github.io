Many Jews write [בס״ד‎](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besiyata%5FDishmaya)[^fn:1], meaning "with the help of Heaven", at the top
of a written document, a reminder that all things come from G-d.
It's not a request for help, but a reminder that help is given. It
feels appropriate for me to follow this tradition in naming my
first blog post for two reasons:

1.  I've never written a blog before and have, honestly, only half
    an idea what I'm doing. I don't think I need to request help
    from a higher power to write this little blog, but it's helpful
    to remember that help is given regardless.
2.  Nothing is harder to write on than a blank page. I've been
    thinking about starting a blog for a while, but had no idea
    where to start. I might as well just put something—anything—on
    the page and get going, else I may never start.

Now I've got writing on the page. The blog has begun. There's a lot
to write about, so let's get started!

[^fn:1]: The full phrase in Aramaic: בְּסִיַּיעְתָּא דִשְׁמַיָּא (transcription: besiyata dishmaya)
