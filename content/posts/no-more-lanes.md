You're driving on your town's Main Street, heading up to the
bowling alley.[^fn:1] But what's this? A traffic jam! How
aggravating, you shout! This is because Main Street just isn't
wide enough, you decide. One More Lane Will Fix It!™

Does this sound familiar? If you're American, you've probably
seen at least one road widening near you in your life, most
likely in an attempt to alleviate congestion. If you've been
around long enough, you've probably seen the same road widened
more than once! But there's still traffic! And that leads to the
big question:

> If adding lanes to the road fixed traffic, why would we have to
> do it more than once?

And here's the big answer we're working towards:

> It doesn't.

In fact, adding lanes can make traffic worse. To find out why,
let's explore [the](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/tag/induced+demand) [oft](https://www.theurbanist.org/2019/11/12/the-law-of-induced-demand-road-widening-and-i-976-invites-congestion/)-[explained](https://www.vox.com/videos/22280067/highways-traffic-worse-congestion-expansion) [concept](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-06/traffic-jam-blame-induced-demand) [of](https://usa.streetsblog.org/category/induced-demand/) [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced%5Fdemand)!


## What induced demand is {#what-induced-demand-is}

Induced demand is the phenomenon in economics that demand
increases with the supply of certain goods. A
non-transportation example is electricity usage: The more the
supply increases (and the price drops), the more electricity
you use. If you could only afford one lightbulb per room in
your house and your electric bill drops in half after the
opening of a new power plant,[^fn:2] you're likely to get a
second bulb for each room. Demand has risen to meet supply.
There are two related phenomena that make up induced demand:
**[latent demand](#orge8d38fc)** and **[generated demand](#org071d201)**.


### <a id="orge8d38fc">Latent demand</a> {#}

If you always wanted more lightbulbs in your house because you
felt like it was too dark, but you couldn't afford the
electricity until the supply increased, that's **[latent demand](#orge8d38fc)**.
The demand existed but couldn't be met by the supply until the
supply increased. The increased supply has **revealed**
additional existing demand.


### <a id="org071d201">Generated demand</a> {#}

But if you didn't have enough lightbulbs before, what did you
do instead? Maybe you didn't want more bulbs; instead, you lit
candles or spent more time at a friend's house with more
light. You found ways around the lack of light, but now that
you can afford more lights, you want them. That's **[generated
        demand](#org071d201)**. The increased supply has **created** additional demand.


## Induced demand on the road {#induced-demand-on-the-road}

Now back to Main Street. Let's say enough people complain about
the traffic[^fn:3] and your town adds a lane to Main Street.
When we approach automobiles with induced demand in our
toolkit, we can see why this is a mistake and explain why
adding lanes doesn't fix traffic. When you add space to the
road, you're both revealing [latent demand](#orge8d38fc) and generating new
demand, and within a short amount of time, the new road space
is filled. If anything, the traffic will get worse! Here's why:


### [Latent demand](#orge8d38fc) on the road {#latent-demand-on-the-road}

Sure, you were driving on Main Street when it had only two
lanes, but the traffic was keeping a lot of other people off
the road—there's only so much space for cars,[^fn:4] and more
people wanted to drive than were able to. Now that we've added
a lane and congestion has improved, though, many of those
drivers will see room for new drivers that they can fill.
Through this lens of [latent demand](#orge8d38fc) we can see a mistaken
assumption that we were making:

> Adding a lane to fix traffic assumes that the number of
> drivers on the road (i.e., the demand for driving on that
> road) will remain constant after adding the lane.

But that wasn't right at all, we see: After increasing the
supply of road space, we end up meeting some of this [latent
        demand](#orge8d38fc). Within months, congestion is just as bad as it was
before. But maybe it's even worse!


### [Generated demand](#org071d201) on the road {#generated-demand-on-the-road}

Through all the traffic on Main Street, you have to imagine
there were some people in your town who simply opted out of
it. If they wanted to go to the bowling alley, maybe they
drove at a different time,[^fn:5] or maybe they walked
instead,[^fn:6] or maybe they never made the trip at
all.[^fn:7]

But now that there's a new lane on Main Street, some of the
drivers who chose to wait will leave at the same time as
everyone else, and new drivers are added to Main Street. After
all, _there's so much more space now!_ And some of the people
who just stayed home decide that they want a piece of the
action too! They start driving to the bowling alley, and new
drivers are added to Main Street. And we haven't talked about
the **opportunity cost** of widening Main Street. Maybe the people
who used to walk to the bowling alley can't do that safely any
more.[^fn:8] Now some of them are swept up in the automotive
arms race too, and new drivers are added to Main Street.
Through this lens of [generated demand](#org071d201) we can see some more
mistaken assumptions we were making:

> Adding a lane to fix traffic assumes:
>
> -   that all drivers want to or should use the road during peak
>     hours, when congestion is worst, when in reality, drivers
>     may use the road during off-peak times instead;
> -   that enabling more car trips makes everyone better off, when
>     there are plenty of people who were perfectly happy not
>     making those trips at all;
> -   and that the goal of transportation planning is to move
>     **cars** rather than **people**, and therefore enabling more
>     cars to use the road improves the system for everyone.

So we may be even worse off than we were before: We've
summoned a horde of new cars to Main Street, and within a few
months, not only has congestion not improved, but it may have
gotten **worse!** Induced demand strikes again!


## What should we do instead? {#what-should-we-do-instead}

So, to recap, we've seen that increasing road space induces
demand for road space, both by revealing [latent demand](#orge8d38fc) and by
creating [generated demand](#org071d201). In other words, adding lanes is
solving traffic with traffic.

Let's take a step back now and ask what problem we were trying
to solve in the first place. Since [transportation is about
helping people live their lives,]({{< relref "what-is-transportation" >}}) and being stuck in traffic
certainly doesn't seem like a great way to live a life, we do
genuinely want to reduce congestion. But if adding space to our
roads just puts more people in cars and doesn't solve
congestion, it's counterproductive to do that. But what if we
go in the **other** direction? If **adding** car space to the road
doesn't fix congestion, maybe **subtracting** it will. More on
that to come!

[^fn:1]: Sure, [Bowling Alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling%5FAlone) is sad, but you're in the mood for some curly fries.
[^fn:2]: Or after solar panels get installed on your roof.
[^fn:3]: I wonder if everyone else was trying to get their bowling alley curly fries fix too…
[^fn:4]: This is basically what traffic congestion is: Too many cars sharing a limited amount of space.
[^fn:5]: The curly fries can wait.
[^fn:6]: Ain't nothing getting between me and those curly fries!
[^fn:7]: Maybe I shouldn't be eating my weight in bowling alley curly fries once a week anyway…
[^fn:8]: One thing American urban planning has done wrong in many places is ignore sidewalks. Wide roads are often built with no place for non-drivers on them; you can probably think of examples you're familiar with.
