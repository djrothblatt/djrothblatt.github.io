Every day[^fn:1], billions of people wake up in one place, attend
to whatever tasks make up their morning, and leave for another
place. That place may be their job, their school, a store or
restaurant, a park, someone else's home, or any number of
other destinations. They get where they're going in any number of
ways: on foot or in a wheelchair; by bike, scooter, or moped;
aboard trains, trams, buses, and ferries; in a car, driven either
by themselves or by someone else. A few hours later, they return
home, either the same way they left or a different way. They may
make some number of stops along the way to their daily
destinations: They may stop at a friend's home or meet friends in
a public place; they may buy ingredients or prepared food for a
meal; they may go to a club for karaoke; or maybe they go
straight home, eager to change clothes and recover from their
day.

This all sounds unremarkable to most of us, even a little boring.
"Big whoop," you may say. "Who cares?" you may ask. But have you
ever asked why we bother with all of this? Every day billions of
people make billions of little round-trip journeys out into the
world. Those trips make up a significant part of most people's
lives. We all occupy ourselves in _transportation_ sometimes. So,
as [the famously depressing poem at Times Square asks](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/thanks-mta-for-the-depressing-af-poem-thats-been-in-this-subway-tunnel-since-the-90s), why bother?


## What is transportation about? {#what-is-transportation-about}

We get our first hint from the way we talked about
transportation above. You wake up in the morning, go somewhere
else, do something in that other place, and return home later.
What can we conclude from this? Well, a couple of things come to
mind:

1.  You have things to do.
2.  You can't do all of them at home, so you have to go somewhere
    else.

"You have things to do" is intentionally vague. Your whole life
is having things to do! So now we can informally define
transportation:

<p class="verse">
Transportation is anything that helps you get to the places where you live your life.<br />
</p>

We all have different goals, desires, obligations, and
relationships, and we can't colocate all of them in the same
place. **So transportation is about us!** It's about living your
life the way you want to live it.


## What is the goal of a transportation system? {#what-is-the-goal-of-a-transportation-system}

Because each of us has our own places to go and things to do, we
rely on _transportation systems_ that can get us where we're
going. There are infinite possible reasons you're making a trip,
and countless possible trips to make, but the system doesn't
need to know anything about those. Whoever you are and whatever
you're doing, it helps you get where you need to go when you
need to go there.

Notice that so far I haven't said anything about the _mode_ of
transportation.[^fn:3] Nor have I said anything about how to lay
out streets or roads.[^fn:4] A transportation system is **not**
successful because it specifically moves cars, bikes, buses,
trains, or anything else. It doesn't succeed because streets are
built on a grid, or not on a grid, or on a grid in **some** spots
but not in others.[^fn:5] A transportation system **is** successful
when it moves people. A transportation system is successful when
it makes it easy for its users to live their lives. All the rest
is commentary.

[^fn:1]: Before[^fn:2] the COVID-19 pandemic, of course
[^fn:2]: And hopefully after!
[^fn:3]: And I won't! Not here!
[^fn:4]: Too important to ignore and too important to even try to write about here.
[^fn:5]: Looking at you, Manhattan!
